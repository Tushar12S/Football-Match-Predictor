# Football-Match-Predictor
The Football Match Prediction and Analysis System is a machine learning-based project designed to predict football match outcomes (win/loss) using historical match data. The system preprocesses the data by converting categorical features such as venue and opponent into numerical codes, extracting temporal features like match day and hour, and creating a binary target variable for match results. A Random Forest Classifier is trained on pre-2022 data and evaluated on post-2022 data, with model performance assessed using accuracy and precision metrics. To incorporate recent performance trends, the system calculates rolling averages for match statistics such as goals, shots, and passes. Additionally, it standardizes team names for consistency and merges team and opponent data to enable comparative analysis. The project demonstrates the integration of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning to provide insights into match outcomes, with potential applications in sports analytics, strategy planning, and fan engagement. Future enhancements could include more advanced feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and visualizations for better interpretability.
